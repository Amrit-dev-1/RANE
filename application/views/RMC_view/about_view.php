                    <br>
					<p>Welcome to Rane Management Consultant Pvt. Ltd., where precision and innovation come together to shape the future of engineering solutions. Established in 1995 under the visionary leadership of Mr. Manmohan Balkrishna Rane, our company has been dedicated to providing precise Land Survey and Land Revenue data crucial for the planning and development of projects by both private and government agencies.
                    <br><br>2
                    Our journey began with a commitment to delivering the highest quality land survey data to support the diverse needs of our clients. Over the years, we have grown and evolved, expanding our scope of services to meet the dynamic demands of the engineering, architectural, and infrastructure sector.
                    <br><br>
                    In 2002, we seized the opportunity to contribute to the development of modern revenue records with the latest equipment and computerized data in Maharashtra by undertaking City Survey projects for various Corporations in the state. With meticulous precision, we successfully completed eight municipal City Survey projects, establishing our reputation as a trusted partner in modern surveying, land revenue expertise, and data acquisition. Notably, our work extended to prominent municipal corporations such as Thane Municipal Corporation, Mira-Bhayander Municipal Corporation, and Vasai-Virar Municipal Corporation.
